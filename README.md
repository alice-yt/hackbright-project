Previously, she worked as a marketing/advertising analyst. She developed an interest in software engineering when she 
worked closely with software engineers and saw how they were able to solve consumer and business problems with 
programming. She is most passionate about products that fulfill a user need, the intersection between human behavior 
and technology, and elegant design. This is her first full-stack project.
